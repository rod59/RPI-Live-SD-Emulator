# QEMU Live SD Card Emulator for Apple Silicone

## About

Live SD Card Emulation is not officially supported as of the creation of these scripts (https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1754). This tool helps compile a modified version of QEMU that can boot a removable drive, and helps streamline the emulation of a Raspberry Pi's SD card without having to take the contents off of the SD card.

## Usage

1 - Set up your environment by running the "setup.sh"

2 - Boot your Raspberry Pi's SD card by running "RPI-Live-SD-Emulator.sh"
